<!-- # Little live exercise

Allow yourself around 15 minutes to try this. Feel free to try this in pairs or larger groups.

I may well ask someone to volunteer a live coding session.

Write a function that takes in two numbers and outputs the max (the greater of the two numbers).

Examples:

```
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4
```

You can start by using any of the following syntax.

```


```

const max = (first, second) => {
if(first > second) }
console.log(first)

    else {

console.log(second)
}

    max(3,8)

}

``` -->

```


const sum = (number) => {
    let result = 0
    for( let i = 1; i <= number; i++>)
    result = result + number
}


sum(10)
```

const max = (num) => {
var maxNumber = num[0]

for( let i = 0; i < num.length; i++)}
if(maxNumber < num{i]
maxnumber = num[i]
}

}

max ([1,2,4,0,8])
